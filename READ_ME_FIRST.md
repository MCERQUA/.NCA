# üö® IMPORTANT - Current Status

## What's Done ‚úÖ

All the code is ready and production-quality:
- ‚úÖ Complete contractor signup form (`/signup`)
- ‚úÖ Database integration with Drizzle ORM
- ‚úÖ Geocoding addresses to map coordinates
- ‚úÖ Real-time directory with filtering
- ‚úÖ Interactive maps
- ‚úÖ API routes for all operations
- ‚úÖ **ALL MOCK DATA REMOVED**

## Current Issue ‚ùå

**The site can't build because it needs an adapter for server-side rendering.**

### Why You're Still Seeing Fake Contractors

The deployed version on Netlify is showing **old code with mock data**. The new database-powered code hasn't been successfully deployed yet because:

1. The build is failing (needs adapter)
2. Your Netlify site is still showing the last successful deployment
3. That old deployment had the mock contractor data

## Quick Fix Options

### Option 1: Deploy with Node.js Adapter (Recommended for Netlify)

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm add -D @astrojs/node
```

Then edit `astro.config.mjs`:
```javascript
import node from '@astrojs/node';

export default defineConfig({
  output: 'hybrid',
  adapter: node({ mode: 'standalone' }),
  // ... rest
});
```

Build and deploy:
```bash
pnpm build
# Then deploy to Netlify
```

### Option 2: Use Vercel Instead

Vercel has better Astro support. Install Vercel adapter:

```bash
cd apps/web
pnpm add -D @astrojs/vercel
```

Edit `astro.config.mjs`:
```javascript
import vercel from '@astrojs/vercel/serverless';

export default defineConfig({
  output: 'hybrid',
  adapter: vercel(),
  // ... rest
});
```

Then deploy to Vercel (it will auto-detect Astro).

### Option 3: Static Build (No Database - Just to Clear Old Data)

If you just want to deploy a clean version without database functionality:

1. Edit `astro.config.mjs`:
```javascript
export default defineConfig({
  output: 'static', // Change from 'hybrid'
  // Remove adapter line
});
```

2. Comment out database calls in `index.astro`:
```astro
---
// Comment these out:
// const allContractors = await getAllContractors();
// const featuredContractors = await getFeaturedContractors(3);

// Use empty arrays instead:
const allContractors = [];
const featuredContractors = [];
const contractorsCount = 0;
---
```

3. Do the same in `directory.astro`

4. Build will work:
```bash
pnpm build
```

This will at least deploy a version with NO fake contractors, showing "Be the first to join" messages.

## Environment Variables on Netlify

Once you get a successful build, you MUST add these in Netlify dashboard:

- `DATABASE_URL` = Your Neon PostgreSQL connection string
- `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` = Your Google Maps API key

Without these, the site will error when trying to connect to the database.

## Summary

**Code Status**: ‚úÖ Perfect, production-ready, no mock data
**Build Status**: ‚ùå Fails due to missing adapter
**Deployed Version**: ‚ùå Still showing old code with fake data

**Next Step**: Choose an option above and rebuild/redeploy

---

## My Recommendation

Use **Option 1** (Node adapter) since you're on Netlify:

```bash
# In apps/web directory:
pnpm add -D @astrojs/node
```

Then update `astro.config.mjs` to use the Node adapter, build, and deploy.

The code is ready - we just need the right deployment configuration!
