## Quick Deployment Commands

```bash
# Check build locally
pnpm build

# Initialize git
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial deployment"

# Add GitHub remote (replace URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO.git
git push -u origin main

## ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

### 1. Add Environment Variables in Netlify

Go to: **Netlify Dashboard â†’ Your Site â†’ Site configuration â†’ Environment variables**

Click "Add a variable" and add these TWO required variables:

**Variable 1:**
- Key: `DATABASE_URL`
- Value: `postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_KpTxIohyB4d7@ep-shiny-union-ad62n69b-pooler.c-2.us-east-1.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require`

**Variable 2:**
- Key: `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY`
- Value: `AIzaSyBdhKFm1TR8q8fdBE1OXSKAwW6i12hXDr8`

### 2. Trigger Redeploy

After adding environment variables:
- Go to **Deploys** tab
- Click "Trigger deploy" â†’ "Deploy site"
- OR wait for automatic deploy from GitHub push

### 3. What to Expect

**During Deploy:**
- Build will take 2-3 minutes
- Check deploy logs for any errors

**After Deploy:**
- Site will show NO fake contractors âœ…
- Homepage will say "Be the first contractor in our network"
- Directory will show "No contractors found"
- Maps will be empty (until someone signs up)

**This is CORRECT** - all mock data is gone!

### 4. Test Contractor Signup

Once deployed:
1. Visit `https://yoursite.netlify.app/signup`
2. Fill out the contractor form completely
3. Submit
4. Visit `/directory` - contractor should appear!
5. Check homepage - marker should show on map!
