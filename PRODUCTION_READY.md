## 📊 Database Schema

### contractors Table
Main table for all contractor profiles:
- **Basic**: name, businessName, category, description
- **Location**: address, city, state, zipCode, latitude, longitude
- **Contact**: phone, email, website
- **Business**: licenseNumber, yearsInBusiness, employeeCount

- **reviews** - Customer reviews with ratings
- **review_photos** - Review image attachments
- **portfolio_items** - Contractor project gallery
- **leads** - Customer inquiry/quote requests
- **categories** - Service category taxonomy
- **users** - User accounts (for future auth)

## 🔐 Current Security Model

**No Authentication Required** (as requested):
- Contractors can sign up without creating an account
- All submissions are automatically approved (`status: 'active'`)
- Contractors appear on map immediately
- No login/dashboard needed

### Future Authentication Options
When you're ready to add authentication:
1. Integrate Stack Auth (already in schema)
