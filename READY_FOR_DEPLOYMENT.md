   - Enable HTTPS (automatic)

4. **Continue Development**
   - Add contractor directory page
   - Integrate Mapbox

   - Set up authentication

## 📊 What's NOT Included Yet

These features are planned but not built (as expected):
- Contractor directory with search
- Map integration (Mapbox)
- Company profile pages
- Authentication (Clerk)
- Payment processing (Stripe)
- Database connection
- Admin dashboard

**These can be added incrementally after deployment!**

## ✨ Key Files to Review Before Deploy

1. **netlify.toml** - Verify build settings
2. **.gitignore** - Ensure .env is ignored
3. **apps/web/astro.config.mjs** - Update site URL if needed
4. **.env.example** - Review environment variables

## 🐛 Known Non-Issues

These warnings during build are **normal and safe**:
- TypeScript unused variable warnings
- Astro inline script hints
- Internal bundler warnings

**Build completes successfully** ✅

## 💡 Tips

- **Forms**: Will only work after deploying to Netlify (not localhost)
- **Environment**: Set `PUBLIC_SITE_URL` in Netlify dashboard
- **Testing**: Use Netlify deploy previews for testing
- **Updates**: Push to GitHub → auto-deploys to Netlify
