# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üìã PROBLEM TRACKING

**BEFORE debugging any issue, check: `PROBLEM_TRACKING.md`**
- All active issues are tracked with attempt history
- Mistake counters prevent repeating the same failed approaches
- If you attempt the same fix >5 times, you're doing it wrong
- Update the tracking file with EVERY attempt and result

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL DEBUGGING PROTOCOL

**WHEN SOMETHING BREAKS - READ THIS FIRST:**

1. **THINK BEFORE SUGGESTING SOLUTIONS**
   - Use `<extra_thinking>` tags to analyze the problem thoroughly
   - The issue is almost ALWAYS in code YOU wrote, not missing environment variables
   - Stop blaming external factors (missing env vars, Netlify config, user setup)

2. **NETLIFY ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES ARE ALREADY CONFIGURED**
   - Netlify has Neon database integration - `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` is auto-provided
   - Google Maps API key is already set up in Netlify dashboard
   - Cloudinary is fully configured via `CLOUDINARY_URL` (contains all credentials in one URL)
   - DO NOT ask the user to add environment variables unless you've verified they're actually missing
   - If the site was working before and broke after your changes, it's YOUR CODE, not env vars

3. **DEBUG PROCESS**
   - First: Review the code YOU just changed
   - Second: Check build logs for actual errors
   - Third: Test locally with the same environment
   - Last: Only then suggest external factors

4. **COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID**
   - Making database connection optional/nullable when it shouldn't be
   - Adding null checks that cause empty results
   - Removing working code and replacing it with broken alternatives
   - Switching between SSR/static modes without understanding the implications
   - Assuming env vars are missing when they're auto-configured

**If something was working and now it's not: YOUR CODE BROKE IT. FIX YOUR CODE.**

### Key Architecture Patterns

1. **Astro Islands**: Use React components sparingly for interactivity (maps, forms), default to Astro components for static content
2. **Static Site Generation**: Project uses `output: 'static'` - all pages are prerendered at build time. Use `client:only="react"` for components that require runtime browser context (auth, cookies)
3. **SEO-Optimized**: BaseLayout.astro provides structured metadata, JSON-LD for all pages
4. **Database**: Drizzle ORM with comprehensive schema supporting users, contractors, reviews, leads, portfolio, categories
5. **Image Management**: Hybrid approach - Cloudinary for user uploads (automatic), public folder for manual admin additions

## Database Schema Highlights

The schema (`apps/web/src/db/schema.ts`) includes:
- **users**: Synced with Stack Auth, supports roles (user, contractor, admin)
- **contractors**: Full profiles with location (lat/lng), verification, ratings, specialties
- **reviews**: With ratings, photos, verification, contractor responses
- **portfolioItems**: Gallery items for contractor work
- **leads**: Contact/quote requests with status tracking
- **categories**: Hierarchical service categories

All tables use proper indexing for performance and include created/updated timestamps.

## Design System

### Brand Colors
- Primary Orange: `#F47A20` (with 50-900 shades in Tailwind)
- Charcoal: `#1F1F23`
- Slate: `#6B7280`

### Typography
- Headings: Poppins (font-heading)
- Body: Inter (font-sans)
- Code: JetBrains Mono (font-mono)

### Components
Located in `apps/web/src/components/ui/`, following shadcn/ui patterns:
- Button.tsx: Variants (default, outline, ghost, link)
- Card.tsx: Composable (Card, CardHeader, CardTitle, CardDescription, CardContent, CardFooter)

Use the `cn()` utility from `lib/utils.ts` for conditional Tailwind classes.

## Environment Variables

### Currently Configured in Netlify (Production)
The following environment variables are **already set up** in Netlify dashboard:
- ‚úÖ **NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL** - Neon PostgreSQL database (auto-configured via Netlify integration)
- ‚úÖ **NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL_UNPOOLED** - Neon unpooled connection (auto-configured)
- ‚úÖ **PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY** - Google Maps API for maps and geocoding
- ‚úÖ **CLOUDINARY_URL** - Cloudinary full URL with credentials (format: `cloudinary://<api_key>:<api_secret>@<cloud_name>`)

### Additional Variables Needed (if using these features)
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local development:
- **STACK_PROJECT_ID, STACK_PUBLISHABLE_CLIENT_KEY, STACK_SECRET_SERVER_KEY** - Stack Auth (optional, for future auth)
- **PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN** - Mapbox integration (optional alternative to Google Maps)
- **PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, STRIPE_SECRET_KEY** - Payment processing (optional, for future premium features)
- **PUBLIC_SITE_URL** - Site URL for SEO and redirects

**Important Notes:**
- Variables prefixed with `PUBLIC_` are exposed to client-side code
- Netlify automatically provides `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` via Neon integration - DO NOT manually add DATABASE_URL
- Google Maps API is already configured - DO NOT ask user to add it again
- **Cloudinary**: Only `CLOUDINARY_URL` is needed - it contains cloud_name, api_key, and api_secret in one URL
  - The SDK automatically parses the URL and extracts all credentials
  - Alternatively, you can set separate `CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME`, `CLOUDINARY_API_KEY`, and `CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET` variables (fallback)

## Deployment

### Netlify (Primary)
Project is configured via `netlify.toml`:
- Build command: `pnpm build`
- Publish directory: `apps/web/dist`
- Base directory: `apps/web`
- Node version: 18

Deploy via:
```bash
netlify deploy        # Preview
netlify deploy --prod # Production
```

### Important Notes
- **DO NOT** deploy to localhost (VPS is for testing only)
- Always push changes to GitHub before deployment
- Forms use Netlify Forms (data-netlify="true" attributes)
- **Netlify Neon Integration**: Database connection is automatic via `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL`
- **Google Maps API**: Already configured in Netlify - do NOT ask user to add it
- Environment variables are managed through Netlify's integrations and dashboard

## Current Status

**Production Ready** ‚úÖ:
- Full database integration with Drizzle ORM
- Complete contractor signup flow (`/signup`) with image uploads
- Cloudinary integration for user-uploaded logos and images
- Real-time directory with search/filter (`/directory`)
- Interactive maps with real contractor data
- Automatic geocoding of addresses
- Homepage with dynamic contractor listings
- API routes for contractor CRUD operations and image uploads
- Hybrid image management (Cloudinary + public folder)
- All fake/mock data removed
- Production deployment ready

**Functional Flow (Contractor Signup)**:
1. Contractor visits `/signup` and fills out complete profile form
2. User optionally uploads logo and/or profile image
3. Images upload to Cloudinary via `/api/upload-image` (returns secure URLs)
4. Form submits to `/api/contractors` (POST) with image URLs
5. API geocodes address using Google Maps Geocoding API
6. Contractor saved to database with coordinates and image URLs
7. Contractor immediately appears in `/directory` and on homepage map with images
8. No authentication or approval required (auto-approve for now)

**Image Management**:
- **User Uploads**: Cloudinary CDN (automatic via signup form)
- **Manual Additions**: Public folder at `/public/contractors/logos/` and `/public/contractors/images/`
- Both approaches store URLs in `contractors.logoUrl` and `contractors.imageUrl` fields
- See `IMAGE_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md` for complete documentation

**Future Enhancements** (see PROJECT_STATUS.md):
- Authentication integration (Stack Auth) for contractor dashboards
- Admin approval workflow before contractors go live
- Review system for customer feedback
- Portfolio/gallery uploads (multiple images per contractor)
- Contractor profile pages (`/company/[slug]`)
- Premium membership features with Stripe

## Performance Targets

- Lighthouse Performance: ‚â•90
- Lighthouse Accessibility: ‚â•95
- Lighthouse SEO: 100
- Time to Interactive: <1.8s
- Core Web Vitals: LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1, INP <200ms

## Development Guidelines

### When Adding New Pages
1. Create `.astro` file in `apps/web/src/pages/`
2. Import and use `BaseLayout` for consistent SEO
3. Add page-specific metadata (title, description, ogImage)
4. Use React islands only for interactive features

### When Modifying Database
1. Update schema in `apps/web/src/db/schema.ts`
2. Run `pnpm db:generate` to create migration
3. Run `pnpm db:push` (dev) or `pnpm db:migrate` (prod)
4. Update relations if adding new tables

### When Adding Components
- Astro components: `.astro` extension for static content
- React components: `.tsx` extension for interactivity
- UI components: Follow shadcn/ui patterns in `components/ui/`
- Use TypeScript for all new components

## Git Workflow

When committing changes, follow the established pattern:
- Push to the NCA project root repository
- Include descriptive commit messages
- Reference the Co-Authored-By convention for AI contributions

## Additional Documentation

- `README.md`: Getting started, project structure
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md`: Detailed feature status and roadmap
- `DEPLOYMENT.md`: Complete deployment guide for GitHub + Netlify
- `IMAGE_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md`: Complete guide for Cloudinary setup and image management (manual + user uploads)
- `national_contractor_association_rebuild_prd_astro_react.md`: Original PRD specifications

## Lessons Learned (DO NOT REPEAT THESE MISTAKES)

### Database Connection Pattern
**WRONG (causes empty results):**
```typescript
let db: ReturnType<typeof drizzle> | null = null;
if (connectionString) {
  db = drizzle(client, { schema });
}
export { db };

// Then in utils:
export async function getAllContractors() {
  if (!db) return []; // This breaks everything!
  return await db.select()...
}
```

**CORRECT (works properly):**
```typescript
if (!connectionString) {
  throw new Error('DATABASE_URL environment variable is not set');
}
const client = postgres(connectionString);
export const db = drizzle(client, { schema });

// Then in utils:
export async function getAllContractors() {
  return await db.select()... // Direct query, no null checks
}
```

**Why this matters:** Netlify provides `NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` automatically. Making the database optional causes it to silently fail and return empty arrays during static generation, resulting in a working build but empty content.

### Environment Variable Priority
Check in this order:
1. `process.env.NETLIFY_DATABASE_URL` (Netlify's Neon integration)
2. `process.env.DATABASE_URL` (fallback)
3. `import.meta.env.*` (Astro's env handling)

DO NOT use `dotenv` to load from `.env` files - Netlify injects environment variables directly into `process.env`.

### Third-Party Library Integration (CRITICAL - LEARNED FROM 15+ FAILED DEPLOYMENTS)

**The Problem:**
Stack Auth was integrated without checking compatibility with Astro's static site generation. This caused a cascade of 15+ deployment failures due to fundamental incompatibility issues.

**RED FLAGS - Check These BEFORE Integrating Any Library:**

1. **Is it designed for your framework?**
   - Stack Auth is built for Next.js (app router, server components, request context)
   - It expects runtime request handling (cookies, headers) not available during static builds
   - ‚ùå **WRONG**: Assuming a React library will "just work" with Astro
   - ‚úÖ **CORRECT**: Check library docs for Astro/SSG compatibility first

2. **Does it require runtime request context?**
   - Libraries that access cookies, headers, or session during component initialization will fail in SSG
   - Error signature: `"cookies/headers was called outside a request scope"`
   - **Solution**: Use `client:only="react"` directive to skip SSR entirely

3. **ESM vs CommonJS package issues:**
   - Modern packages may export dual formats causing build-time conflicts
   - Error signature: `"Unexpected token 'export'"` or `"default is not exported"`
   - **Solution**: Add to Vite's `ssr.noExternal` config to force bundling

**Stack Auth Specific Issues Encountered:**

1. **TypeScript API Changes** (v2 ‚Üí v3)
   - Old API: Pass `projectId` and `publishableClientKey` as props
   - New API: Create `StackClientApp` instance and pass via `app` prop
   - **Fix**: Updated to v3 API with proper initialization

2. **CommonJS/ESM Dual Package Hazard**
   - Package behaves differently in server build (CommonJS) vs client build (ESM)
   - **Fix**: Use namespace import: `import * as StackFramework from "@stackframe/stack"`
   - **Fix**: Add to `vite.ssr.noExternal` to force bundling

3. **Environment Variable Initialization**
   - Library throws if project ID not found, even when feature is optional
   - **Fix**: Conditional initialization with graceful degradation
   - **Fix**: Use Astro's `import.meta.env.*` not `process.env.*`

4. **Request Context During Static Build**
   - StackClientApp tries to access cookies during SSR/prerendering
   - This is fundamentally incompatible with static site generation
   - **Fix**: Use `client:only="react"` instead of `client:load` to skip SSR

**Correct Approach for Auth in Static Sites:**

```astro
---
// signin.astro
export const prerender = true;
import { SignInCard } from '../components/SignInCard';
---

<!-- ‚ùå WRONG: client:load tries to SSR during build -->
<SignInCard client:load />

<!-- ‚úÖ CORRECT: client:only skips SSR, only renders in browser -->
<SignInCard client:only="react" />
```

**Astro Client Directives - When to Use:**

- `client:load` - Hydrate immediately on page load (component SSRs during build)
- `client:idle` - Hydrate when browser idle (component SSRs during build)
- `client:visible` - Hydrate when scrolled into view (component SSRs during build)
- `client:only="react"` - **SKIP SSR entirely**, only render in browser (use for auth, cookies, request context)

**Before Integrating ANY Third-Party Library:**

1. ‚úÖ Check official docs for framework compatibility
2. ‚úÖ Search for "astro [library-name]" to see if others have succeeded
3. ‚úÖ Look for runtime dependencies (cookies, headers, session, request)
4. ‚úÖ Test locally with `pnpm build` (not just `pnpm dev`) BEFORE committing
5. ‚úÖ Consider if the feature actually needs SSR or can be client-only

**When You Break the Build:**

1. **Don't make confident claims** about "should work" until you see actual build logs
2. **Read the error carefully** - it usually tells you exactly what's wrong
3. **Consider removing the feature** if it causes cascading issues (auth can be added later)
4. **Use `client:only`** as a first attempt for problematic React components
5. **Check Vite config** for ESM/CommonJS bundling issues (`ssr.noExternal`)

**Why This Matters:**

The Stack Auth integration attempt caused 15+ consecutive deployment failures because we didn't verify compatibility upfront. Each "fix" revealed a new incompatibility. The correct solution was identified on attempt #16: use `client:only` to skip SSR entirely, since auth components inherently need runtime request context that SSG cannot provide.

**Current Stack Auth Status:**

- ‚úÖ Builds successfully with `client:only="react"` directive
- ‚úÖ Environment variables are optional (graceful degradation if not configured)
- ‚úÖ Component only renders in browser where request context exists
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: If Stack Auth continues causing issues, remove it entirely - the core contractor directory does NOT need authentication to function
